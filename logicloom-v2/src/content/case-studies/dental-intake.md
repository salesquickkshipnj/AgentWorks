\## The Problem



Missed calls + inconsistent follow-ups were leaking appointments.



\## The Solution

We deployed an AI intake workflow that triages requests, books/reschedules, and triggers recall sequences.



\## The Outcome

More booked chairs, fewer manual callbacks, and cleaner patient records.
