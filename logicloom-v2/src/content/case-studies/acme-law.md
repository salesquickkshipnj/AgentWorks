## Overview

The firm was losing leads during peak hours. Intake was split across email, calls, and forms—so follow-ups were inconsistent and case files were created late.

We built a streamlined intake + case kickoff system that captures leads, qualifies them, creates the file structure, and generates documents automatically.

## The Problem

- Leads arrived from multiple channels with no consistent tracking  
- Staff retyped client data into the case management system  
- Document templates were created manually and inconsistently  
- Follow-up delays caused lost opportunities  
- Case kickoff depended on someone “remembering” the next step

## What We Built

### 1) Centralized intake capture
Every lead—form, email, or referral—lands in one pipeline with:

- Duplicate detection
- Clean formatting (names, phones, addresses)
- Source tagging

### 2) Fast qualification + routing
- Basic qualification questions are handled automatically
- Leads are categorized (urgent, standard, not a fit)
- The right person is notified with a complete summary

### 3) Case file creation
When a lead becomes a client:

- A case is created in the case management system
- A folder structure is generated automatically
- Key documents are attached and labeled consistently

### 4) Document automation
- Engagement letter generated from approved templates
- Signature request sent automatically
- Signed docs saved to the correct case folder

## Integrations

- Intake forms (webhooks)
- Case management platform (Clio / PracticePanther)
- eSignature (DocuSign)
- Email + file storage (Google / Microsoft)

## Results

- Faster response time to new inquiries  
- Fewer dropped leads during busy hours  
- Cleaner, consistent case files from day one  
- Less admin overhead for staff  

## Why It Worked

- Clear “states” (new lead → qualified → retained)  
- No manual copying between tools  
- Automatic next-step enforcement (no guessing)

## Next Steps

- Add billing triggers + invoice automation
- Add client status notifications
- Add referral tracking and reporting
